   ##  Overview   
  This project is a web scraping application designed to extract data from a specific website. The website we targeted for scraping is [Website Name or URL]. The goal of this project is to collect data about [Specify the type of data or content you are scraping, e.g., products, news articles, etc.] from the website for further analysis or use.
  
  ## Project Structure
  
  The project consists of the following components:
  
  1. **my_crawler.py**: This Python script contains the web scraping logic. It uses the `requests` library to make HTTP requests to the website, retrieves the HTML content, and parses it using the `BeautifulSoup` library. The script is organized into classes to manage different aspects of the scraping process.
  
  2. **Product Class**: A class representing the data structure of the items we are scraping. The `Product` class holds information such as the product name, price, and image.
  
  3. **Crawler Class**: The `Crawler` class manages the scraping process. It has methods to fetch web pages, extract data, and handle pagination (if applicable). It also includes error handling to gracefully deal with exceptions.
